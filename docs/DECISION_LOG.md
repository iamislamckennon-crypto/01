# Decision Log

## Overview
This decision log documents architectural and implementation decisions for the competitive remote dice roll gaming platform. Each entry captures the context, decision, alternatives considered, rationale, and follow-up actions to ensure transparency and enable future review.

**Purpose:**
- Provide audit trail for key technical decisions
- Document rationale and alternatives for future reference
- Enable new team members to understand decision history
- Support decision review and retrospective analysis

**Maintenance:**
- Add new entries as decisions are made
- Update status as decisions evolve
- Link to related research sources and prototypes
- Review quarterly for deprecated decisions

### [DEC-001] Research Documentation Framework (Example)
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Stakeholders:** Research Team, Engineering Team  
**Related Decisions:** N/A (First decision)

**Context:**
The project requires systematic research to inform architectural decisions for fairness, anti-cheat, verification, and audit mechanisms. Without a structured approach, decisions may be made ad-hoc, leading to inconsistency and potential rework. Need to establish a repeatable methodology for evidence-based decision making.

**Decision:**
Implement a comprehensive research documentation framework consisting of:
1. RESEARCH_PLAN.md - Detailed methodology and evaluation criteria
2. RESEARCH_SOURCES.md - Curated catalog of references
3. scripts/research/collect_sources.js - Automation scaffold
4. DECISION_LOG.md - This document for tracking decisions

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Lightweight Wiki Approach:**
   - Pros: 
     - Quick to set up
     - Flexible structure
     - Easy collaboration
   - Cons:
     - Less structured, harder to maintain consistency
     - No automation scaffolding
     - Difficult to version control
     - Risk of becoming disorganized over time

2. **Issue-Based Documentation:**
   - Pros:
     - Integrated with GitHub workflow
     - Good for tracking discussions
     - Easy to reference from code
   - Cons:
     - Not suitable for comprehensive research documentation
     - Difficult to maintain cross-references
     - Limited formatting and structure
     - Hard to get holistic view

3. **External Research Management Tool:**
   - Pros:
     - Purpose-built features (Zotero, Notion, etc.)
     - Advanced search and tagging
     - Collaboration features
   - Cons:
     - Additional tool dependency
     - Not version controlled with code
     - Potential cost
     - Learning curve for team

**Rationale:**
Chose structured Markdown files in repository because:
- **Version Control:** Changes tracked alongside code, enabling correlation between research and implementation
- **Accessibility:** Markdown is readable in plain text, renders well on GitHub, low barrier to contribution
- **Automation Potential:** Can build scripts to parse and analyze documentation programmatically
- **Integration:** Easy to link from code comments, commit messages, and pull requests
- **Portability:** Not locked into proprietary tools, can migrate easily
- **Cost:** Zero additional tooling costs
- **Consistency:** Forces structured thinking through templates

Accepted tradeoff: More manual maintenance compared to specialized research tools, but gain better integration with development workflow.

**Consequences:**
- Positive:
  - Clear methodology established for future research
  - Documentation lives with code
  - Foundation for automation built
  - Easy onboarding for new team members
- Negative:
  - Requires discipline to maintain
  - Manual updates needed until automation built
  - Less sophisticated than dedicated research tools
- Risks:
  - Documentation could become outdated if not maintained
  - Team may skip documentation if it feels burdensome
  
**Follow-up Actions:**
- [x] Create initial documentation structure
- [ ] Populate RESEARCH_SOURCES.md with first 10 sources (Phase 2)
- [ ] Implement automated source collection in collect_sources.js (Phase 2)
- [ ] Train team on documentation standards
- [ ] Set up quarterly review process

**References:**
- Research sources: See RESEARCH_PLAN.md for methodology
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR) pattern: https://adr.github.io/
- Documentation-as-Code principles

**Notes:**
This framework is intentionally designed to evolve. Start with manual processes in Phase 1, add automation in Phase 2+. Revisit structure if it proves inadequate after 3 months of use.
