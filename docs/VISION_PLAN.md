# Vision and Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-phase vision for the physical dice detection and verification system, tracking progress and future enhancements.

## Project Goals

1. **Eliminate Manual Value Entry:** System-controlled detection replaces player-declared values
2. **Tamper Resistance:** Multi-layer verification prevents cheating
3. **Fairness Verification:** Cryptographic audit trail ensures game integrity
4. **Dispute Resolution:** Structured opponent confirmation and reroll mechanisms
5. **Scalability:** Architecture supports future ML/CV enhancements

## Phase 1: Independent Detection (COMPLETE) ✓

**Status:** Implemented  
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-21

### Features Delivered

#### Client-Side Detection
- ✓ Baseline surface frame capture (F0)
- ✓ Motion-based stabilization detection
- ✓ 3-frame consensus capture (F1, F2, F3)
- ✓ Deterministic pip detection (grayscale + threshold + blob detection)
- ✓ Single die support (ALLOW_MULTI_DICE flag for future)
- ✓ Evidence package builder

#### Server-Side Verification
- ✓ Evidence structure validation
- ✓ Consensus logic (≥2/3 frames must agree)
- ✓ Hash chain integration (ROLL_EVIDENCE event type)
- ✓ Timing enforcement (DETECTION_WINDOW, STABILIZATION_MAX)
- ✓ Camera movement detection (pixel diff check)
- ✓ Violation tracking

#### Endpoints Implemented
- ✓ `POST /api/gameroom/:id/submit-evidence`
- ✓ `POST /api/gameroom/:id/confirm-opponent`
- ✓ `POST /api/gameroom/:id/request-reroll`
- ✓ `GET /api/gameroom/:id/hash-chain`

#### Testing

### Key Achievements

1. **Deterministic Detection:** Simple but reliable pip detection without ML dependencies
2. **Consensus-Based Verification:** Multi-frame approach reduces false positives
3. **Tamper Detection:** Camera movement and timing violations tracked
4. **Dispute Resolution:** Opponent confirmation with limited reroll mechanism
5. **Audit Trail:** Complete hash chain of all detection events

### Known Limitations

1. **Single Die Only:** Multi-die detection requires layout validation (Phase 2)
2. **Simple Blob Detection:** May struggle with poor lighting or unusual dice
3. **No ML/CV:** Advanced recognition deferred to Phase 2
4. **In-Memory Storage:** Production requires persistent database
5. **Simple Hash:** Demo hash function (use crypto.subtle.digest in production)
