# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the tasks that must be completed before deploying this Cloudflare dice platform to production.

## DNS & SSL Configuration (3 tasks)

1. [ ] Configure custom domain in Cloudflare dashboard
2. [ ] Enable Universal SSL certificate for the domain
3. [ ] Set up DNS records pointing to Cloudflare Workers/Pages

4. [ ] Generate and configure Turnstile site key and secret key
5. [ ] Set TURNSTILE_SECRET as a Worker secret using `wrangler secret put`
6. [ ] Configure allowed origins (ORIGIN_ALLOWED) for production domain
7. [ ] Implement key rotation policy for TURNSTILE_SECRET (quarterly recommended)
8. [ ] Review and strengthen rate limiting thresholds for production traffic
9. [ ] Enable Cloudflare WAF rules for `/api/*` endpoints
10. [ ] Configure bot protection rules specifically for registration endpoint
11. [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting rules in Cloudflare dashboard

## Observability & Monitoring (6 tasks)

12. [ ] Set up Cloudflare Workers Analytics dashboard monitoring
13. [ ] Configure log retention and archival strategy
14. [ ] Create alerting rules for high error rates (>5%)
15. [ ] Set up real-time monitoring dashboard for fairness anomalies
16. [ ] Implement structured logging pipeline to external aggregator (e.g., Datadog, Splunk)
17. [ ] Configure performance metrics tracking (p50, p95, p99 latencies)

## Data Persistence & Backup (4 tasks)

18. [ ] Configure Durable Objects backup strategy for game state
19. [ ] Implement hash chain snapshot export to R2 storage
20. [ ] Set up automated backup schedule (daily recommended)
21. [ ] Document data retention policy and compliance requirements

## Testing & Quality Assurance (5 tasks)

22. [ ] Execute comprehensive load testing (target: 1000 concurrent rooms)
23. [ ] Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
24. [ ] Complete threat modeling exercise for commitment-reveal mechanism
25. [ ] Run synthetic monitoring tests from multiple geographic locations
26. [ ] Validate PWA installation on iOS, Android, and desktop browsers

## Compliance & Legal (4 tasks)

27. [ ] Implement cookie consent banner (GDPR/CCPA compliance)
28. [ ] Add privacy policy covering data collection and usage
29. [ ] Include terms of service with user agreement
30. [ ] Add disclaimer for video recording if camera features are enabled

## Performance Optimization (3 tasks)

31. [ ] Enable Cloudflare CDN caching for static assets
32. [ ] Configure image optimization for PWA icons
33. [ ] Implement lazy loading for non-critical UI components

## Documentation & Support (4 tasks)

34. [ ] Create API documentation with example requests/responses
35. [ ] Write user guide for fairness verification process
36. [ ] Document incident response playbook
37. [ ] Prepare runbook for common operational tasks

## Scalability Planning (3 tasks)

38. [ ] Configure auto-scaling for Durable Objects
39. [ ] Plan for geographic distribution (multi-region deployment)
40. [ ] Establish capacity planning baseline and growth projections

## Additional Recommendations

### Short-term (Pre-launch)

- Review all TODO comments in codebase for integration points
- Verify WebSocket connection limits and adjust if needed
- Test offline PWA functionality on various network conditions
- Validate accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA standard)

### Medium-term (Post-launch)

- Implement ML-based reputation model improvements
- Add computer vision pipeline for physical dice verification
- Integrate on-chain VRF for enhanced randomness verification
- Build tournament system with leaderboard

### Long-term (Roadmap)

- Explore hardware dice integration via IoT protocols
- Implement automated Merkle tree anchoring to blockchain
- Add support for multi-game formats
- Develop mobile native applications

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

1. [ ] All tests passing (`npm test`)
2. [ ] Security scan completed (CodeQL or equivalent)
3. [ ] All secrets configured in Cloudflare Workers
4. [ ] Environment variables set for production
5. [ ] WAF rules activated
6. [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
7. [ ] Backup procedures tested
8. [ ] Rollback plan documented
9. [ ] Team notified of deployment
10. [ ] Post-deployment verification script ready

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. [ ] Verify health check endpoints responding
2. [ ] Confirm WebSocket connections establishing successfully
3. [ ] Test complete game flow end-to-end
4. [ ] Validate Turnstile integration working
5. [ ] Check PWA installation on test devices
6. [ ] Monitor error rates for first 24 hours
7. [ ] Review performance metrics against baseline
8. [ ] Validate backup systems running

## Emergency Contacts

Document emergency contacts for:

- Cloudflare support escalation
- Security incident response team
- On-call engineer rotation
- Legal/compliance team

## Notes

- Estimated time to complete all tasks: 40-60 hours
- Critical path items: #4, #5, #6, #22, #23
- Blocker for go-live: Tasks #1-11 must be completed
