# Competitive Dice Roll Gaming Platform Prototype

## Project Overview
This project is a competitive dice roll gaming platform prototype that allows users to participate in thrilling dice rolling games with a competitive edge.

## Features
- Real-time multiplayer gaming
- Intuitive user interface
- Various game modes and rules
- Leaderboard tracking

## Security / Anti-Cheating Mechanisms
- Secure random number generation for dice rolls
- Player authentication and session management
- Monitoring and logging of all game actions to detect anomalies

## Architecture
The architecture of the platform consists of:
- Frontend: Built with React.js for a responsive user experience.
- Backend: Node.js with Express for handling game logic and user sessions.
- Database: MongoDB for storing user data and game records.

## Research
The platform development is guided by comprehensive research into fairness, anti-cheat mechanisms, cryptographic randomness, and trust systems. Our research framework ensures evidence-based decision making and transparency.

### Research Documentation
- **[Research Plan](RESEARCH_PLAN.md)** - Detailed research objectives, methodology, evaluation criteria, and deliverables across 8 key dimensions:
  - Existing Platforms & Benchmarks
  - Randomness & Fairness (VRF, commit-reveal, randomness beacons)
  - Anti-Cheat & Verification (computer vision, video authentication)
  - Reputation & Trust Models (ELO, Glicko, Bayesian trust)
  - Audit & Transparency (Merkle trees, blockchain anchoring)
  - Community Sentiment & Adoption
  - Risk & Ethical Considerations
  - Competitive & Differentiation Analysis

- **[Research Sources](RESEARCH_SOURCES.md)** - Living catalog of curated references including academic papers, open-source projects, standards, and community discussions

- **[Decision Log](docs/DECISION_LOG.md)** - Architectural decision records documenting context, alternatives, rationale, and follow-up actions

### Research Automation
The `scripts/research/collect_sources.js` script provides scaffolding for future automated research source collection, classification, and scoring:

```bash
node scripts/research/collect_sources.js
```

This script outlines planned tasks for source discovery across all research dimensions and provides integration points for future automation.
