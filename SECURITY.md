# Security and Anti-Cheat Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and anti-cheat strategies implemented in the competitive dice roll gaming platform to ensure fair play, data integrity, and user privacy.

## Anti-Cheat Strategy

### Multi-Layered Detection System

#### 1. Video Analysis (Current & Planned)
**Current Implementation:**
- Video stream capture from player cameras
- Basic metadata validation (frame rate, resolution, continuity)
- Timestamp verification for roll sequences

**Planned Enhancements:**
- **Computer Vision Analysis**: 
  - Automated dice detection and tracking
  - Motion analysis to detect unnatural movements
  - Dice face recognition and value verification
  - Shadow and lighting consistency analysis
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Pattern recognition for loaded/weighted dice behavior
  - Anomaly detection in roll physics
  - Fake video stream detection

#### 2. Statistical Analysis
**Current Implementation:**
- Roll sequence storage and historical tracking
- Basic frequency analysis placeholder

**Planned Enhancements:**
- **Distribution Analysis**: 
  - Chi-square tests for randomness
  - Detection of statistically improbable roll patterns
  - Comparison against expected probability distributions
- **Temporal Analysis**:
  - Roll timing patterns (too consistent = suspicious)
  - Session-level behavioral profiling
- **Cross-Player Analysis**:
  - Correlation detection between colluding players
  - Win rate analysis adjusted for opponent skill

#### 3. Behavioral Monitoring
**Active Monitoring:**
- Camera obstruction detection
- Stream interruption logging
- Rapid re-roll patterns
- Unusual delay patterns between rolls

**Reputation-Based Factors:**
- Historical flag count
- Dispute resolution outcomes
- Peer feedback integration
- Account age and activity patterns

### Real-Time Flagging System

#### Automatic Flags
The system automatically flags suspicious activity:
- **High Severity**: Clear camera obstruction, stream manipulation, impossible roll sequences
- **Medium Severity**: Statistical anomalies, unusual roll physics, timing inconsistencies  
- **Low Severity**: Minor technical issues, borderline statistical deviations

#### Human Review Integration
- Flagged sessions marked for potential review
- Evidence packages prepared automatically
- Community moderation system (planned)
- Appeals process with evidence examination

## Data Logging and Retention

### Comprehensive Game Records

#### Stored Data Per Game:
- **Video Evidence**:
  - Full roll video streams (compressed, encrypted)
  - Timestamps for each roll action
  - Video metadata (resolution, frame rate, codec)
- **Roll Details**:
  - Player ID and timestamp
  - Dice values and confidence scores
  - Anti-cheat flags and severity
  - Video proof references
- **Session Metadata**:
  - Player list and roles (host, participants)
  - Game status progression
  - Duration and completion status
  - Dispute events and resolutions

#### Retention Policies:
- **Standard Games**: 30 days video retention, permanent metadata
- **Disputed Games**: 90 days video retention, permanent detailed records
- **Flagged Players**: Extended retention for investigation
- **Privacy Compliance**: User data deletion requests honored within legal requirements

### Audit Trail
- All game actions logged with immutable timestamps
- Administrative actions tracked and reviewable
- System modifications versioned and documented
- Blockchain integration planned for tamper-proof logging

## Privacy Considerations

### User Data Protection

#### Personal Information:
- **Minimal Collection**: Only necessary data collected (username, country, email for recovery)
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to user data; strict internal policies
- **Anonymization**: Research and analytics use anonymized datasets

#### Video Privacy:
- **Consent**: Players explicitly consent to video recording when joining games
- **Purpose Limitation**: Video used only for game verification and dispute resolution
- **No Facial Recognition**: System focuses on dice and rolling surface, not player identification
- **Deletion Rights**: Players can request deletion of non-disputed game videos

#### Third-Party Sharing:
- **No Selling**: User data never sold to third parties
- **Limited Sharing**: Only shared with law enforcement when legally required
- **Partner Integration**: Future integrations require user consent and privacy review

### Security Best Practices

#### Authentication & Authorization:
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, short-lived tokens for session management
- **Password Hashing**: Industry-standard bcrypt/argon2 for credential storage
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and API abuse
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Planned for high-reputation accounts

#### Network Security:
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3+
- **CORS Policies**: Strict origin controls to prevent unauthorized access
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage

#### Infrastructure:
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies kept current with security patches
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activity
- **Backup**: Regular encrypted backups with disaster recovery plan
- **Penetration Testing**: Scheduled security audits (planned)

## Planned Computer Vision Enhancements

- Dice detection in video frames
- Simple motion tracking
- Basic obstruction detection
- Value recognition with confidence scoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (12 months)

## Cryptographically Verifiable Randomness

### Current State:
- Server-side pseudorandom generation (Math.random wrapper)
- Timestamp-based seeding
- Basic unpredictability

### Planned Implementation:

#### Hybrid System:
1. **Physical Dice (Primary)**:
   - Real dice rolls verified by video
   - Computer vision validates physical randomness
   - Fallback for technical issues only

2. **Cryptographic Backup**:
   - **Commit-Reveal Protocol**: 
     - Player commits to seed before roll
     - Server provides witness value
     - Result derived from combined entropy
   - **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**:
     - Publicly verifiable random outputs
     - Prevents server manipulation
   - **Distributed Randomness**:
     - Chainlink VRF or similar oracle integration
     - Multiple entropy sources combined

#### Transparency:

- Seeds and outputs published after games
- Third-party audits of randomness
- Player verification tools provided

## Trust and Reputation Model

### Reputation Scoring Algorithm

#### Score Components:
- **Base Factors** (70%):
  - Games completed cleanly: +10 per game
  - Disputed games with violations: -50 per incident
  - False flag penalties: -25 per false flag
  - Abandoned games: -15 per abandonment

- **Community Factors** (20%):
  - Peer ratings (1-5 stars post-game)
  - Endorsements from established players
  - Tournament participation bonuses

- **Time Factors** (10%):
  - Account age bonus (decay of negative events over time)
  - Recent activity weight (recent behavior matters more)
  - Consistency rewards (regular clean play)

### Reputation Tiers:

| Tier | Score Range | Benefits | Restrictions |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **Legendary** | 2500+ | Priority matchmaking, exclusive tournaments, verified badge | None |
| **Elite** | 1500-2499 | Tournament access, reduced dispute scrutiny | None |
| **Trusted** | 1000-1499 | Standard access, good standing indicator | None |
| **Established** | 500-999 | Full platform access | None |
| **Developing** | 100-499 | Full access, still building reputation | Minor additional verification |
| **New** | 0-99 | Introductory games, learning period | Limited to friendly matches initially |
| **Cautionary** | -99-0 | Restricted matchmaking, additional monitoring | Enhanced anti-cheat measures |
| **Suspended** | -100 or lower | Temporary ban, appeal possible | Cannot play pending review |

### Reputation Recovery:
- Players can recover from negative reputation through consistent clean play
- Appeals process for disputed violations
- Time-based decay of old penalties (6-12 months)
- Community service options (beta testing, moderation assistance)

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection:
1. Automated systems flag suspicious activity

2. **Likely Violation**: Warning, increased monitoring, evidence preserved
3. **Inconclusive**: Notation in record, no penalty, continued monitoring
4. **False Positive**: Clear player record, investigate system improvement

### Communication:
- Players notified of actions against them with evidence summary
- Right to appeal with additional evidence
- Transparency reports published quarterly (anonymized)
