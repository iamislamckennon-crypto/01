# Anti-Cheating Mechanisms

## Overview
This document outlines the technical and procedural mechanisms implemented to prevent cheating and detect bad actor behavior in remote dice roll gaming.

## Technical Safeguards

### Video Verification Systems

#### 1. Camera Positioning Detection
**Purpose**: Ensure camera provides clear, unobstructed view of rolls
- **Implementation**: 
  - Computer vision analysis to detect camera angle
  - Alert if camera moves significantly during gameplay
  - Require calibration check before each game session
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Sudden camera movement during rolls
  - Obstructions entering frame
  - Insufficient lighting conditions

#### 2. Timestamped Video Recording
**Purpose**: Prevent pre-recorded roll playback
- **Implementation**:
  - All video streams timestamped with server time
  - Real-time latency checks between streams
  - Video fingerprinting to detect replays
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Timestamp mismatches
  - Identical frame sequences
  - Network latency inconsistencies

#### 3. Dice Tracking and Pattern Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify suspicious roll patterns
- **Implementation**:
  - Computer vision to track dice position and rotation
  - Statistical analysis of roll outcomes per player
  - Machine learning model to identify anomalies
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Statistically improbable roll sequences
  - Biased outcomes favoring specific numbers
  - Abnormal dice behavior (e.g., minimal rotation)

#### 4. Verification Gestures
**Purpose**: Confirm live, real-time participation
- **Implementation**:
  - Random gesture requirements (e.g., wave hand, show specific number of fingers)
  - Requested at unpredictable intervals
  - Must be completed within 5-second window
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Delayed or absent responses
  - Repeated identical responses
  - Failure to complete gesture correctly

### Data Logging and Auditing

#### 1. Comprehensive Session Logging
**Purpose**: Enable post-game review and investigation
- **Logged Data**:
  - All dice rolls with timestamps
  - Player actions and inputs
  - Video stream metadata
  - Chat messages and voice communications
  - Session join/leave events
- **Storage**: 
  - Encrypted storage for 90 days
  - Accessible only for dispute resolution
  - Anonymized data for pattern analysis

#### 2. Anomaly Detection System
**Purpose**: Automatically flag suspicious behavior
- **Monitored Metrics**:
  - Win/loss ratios per player
  - Average roll values
  - Response times to prompts
  - Session participation patterns
- **Actions**:
  - Automatic flagging of outliers
  - Manual review queue for moderators
  - Player risk scoring system

#### 3. Community Reporting
**Purpose**: Leverage player community for detection
- **Implementation**:
  - In-game reporting button
  - Post-game rating system
  - Anonymous tip submission
- **Processing**:
  - Reports trigger automatic review
  - Multiple reports escalate priority
  - False reporting penalties

## Procedural Safeguards

### Pre-Game Verification

#### 1. Equipment Check
- Players must display their dice from all angles
- Rolling surface must be shown clearly
- Camera positioning verified by system

#### 2. Player Authentication
- Verified account required for competitive games
- Multi-factor authentication for high-stakes games
- Account linking to prevent ban evasion

### During Game Monitoring

#### 1. Real-Time Moderation
- Automated monitoring of all sessions
- AI-assisted detection of rule violations
- Quick response to player reports

#### 2. Progressive Challenge System
- Random verification challenges during gameplay
- Increased frequency for flagged players
- Failure results in automatic game forfeit

### Post-Game Review

#### 1. Automated Analysis
- Statistical analysis of all rolls
- Pattern matching against known cheating methods
- Risk score assignment to each player

#### 2. Manual Review Process
- Flagged games reviewed by moderators
- Video evidence examined frame-by-frame
- Community input considered in decisions

## Player Reputation System

### Trust Score Components
1. **Game History**: Number of games completed
2. **Verification Success**: Response rate to challenges
3. **Community Rating**: Average rating from other players
4. **Violation History**: Number and severity of infractions
5. **Account Age**: Longevity and activity level

### Trust Score Impact
- **High Trust (90-100)**: 
  - Fewer verification challenges
  - Access to premium games
  - Community recognition
- **Medium Trust (60-89)**:
  - Standard verification requirements
  - All game modes available
- **Low Trust (30-59)**:
  - Increased monitoring
  - Limited game access
  - Required improvement period
- **Untrusted (0-29)**:
  - Heavy restrictions
  - Probationary status
  - Risk of suspension

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection
- Video recordings encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access logs maintained for all data viewing
- Automatic deletion after retention period
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

### User Rights
- Players can request their data
- Option to delete account and data
- Transparency in data usage
- Clear privacy policy

### Balancing Security and Privacy
- Minimize data collection to necessary only
- Anonymize data for analysis when possible
- Provide opt-in for additional security features
- Regular privacy audits

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
- Regular analysis of cheating attempts
- Updates to detection algorithms
- Community input on new rules
- Transparency reports on enforcement

### Technology Updates
- Integration of new computer vision techniques
- Enhanced machine learning models
- Blockchain for immutable logging (future consideration)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for verification (research phase)

## Response to Violations

### Automated Actions
1. **Minor Violations**: Warning and educational content
2. **Moderate Violations**: Temporary suspension (24-72 hours)
3. **Severe Violations**: Extended suspension or permanent ban

### Appeal Process
- Players can appeal all automated decisions
- Human review for all appeals
- Evidence submission window
- Final decision within 7 days

### Transparency
- Public statistics on violation rates
- Regular updates on enforcement actions
- Anonymous case studies for education
